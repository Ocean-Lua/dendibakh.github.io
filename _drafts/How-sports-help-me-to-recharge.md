This post is not what I usually blog about. :) I regularly write about technical stuff, not about personal life and fitness. But damn, sometimes it's okay to change something. Anyway, keep on reading, but remember I warned you, there will be zero technical value in this post.

One reader of my blog wrote to me: "Hey, I found your instagram account and at first though it's not you, there are so many sports photos." Well, yeah, that's true. Sports was always a part of my live. I don't remeber a single week I haven't been excercising. Maybe except when I was sick. And over the past few years I started feeling how I essentially can't live without going for a little running workout or playing soccer.

Whenever I feel overwhelmed I try to wrap up any activity I'm now working on and do some sports.

All the greatest thoughts are comming while running. It is funny, but often times I come from my workout and immediately write down the thought that came while I was running. I don't know how it works on the body level, but I feel so much more confident while running. I'm ready to tackle any challenge I might face.

Additionally I always listen audiobooks while running. I have Audible subscription which provides me with hours of good audiobooks. While running I listened to a quite big amount of audiobooks I wouldn't find the time to listen otherwise. It is 2in1: it not only saves my time, but it helps to be distracted from actual running. For professionals this is rather a drawback then an upside, but for me it's good. Sometimes the 5 miles run feels like 5 minutes when all my thoughts are about the book I'm listening to.

Everything what I wrote is not new, I know. But if I could inspire at least one reader to make sports a daily routine, I will consider it a success.
