To add:

Power event trace.

It is great for analyzing cold paths.

The only things that is missing is printf style debugging. This is probably the only significant reason why you would want to instrument your code manually.

Put the link for library for collecting traces. Will be useful in Windows context.

Just as a final note I want to say that for most of my daily work at Intel, PT is rather an overkill and traditional approach works just fine. But still I recall a number of cases where using Intel PT would expedite the analysis and exactly one case where I did use it. :)
